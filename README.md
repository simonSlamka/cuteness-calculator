This project is a cuteness calculator. It uses computer vision techniques to calculate the cuteness of a face in an image. The cuteness is calculated based on several features such as eye aspect ratio, face aspect ratio, eye area, cheek fullness, smile width, facial proportions, and eye to face ratio. These features are extracted using facial landmarks detected by dlib's shape predictor.

### Files

* `main.py`: This is the main file that you run to calculate the cuteness of a face in an image. It takes in three arguments: the path to the image file, the path to the dlib shape predictor file, and the path to the directory of images.
* `cuteness_calculator.py`: This file contains the `CutenessCalculator` class which has methods to calculate the cuteness of a face in an image.
* `landmarks_detector.py`: This file contains the `LandmarksDetector` class which has methods to get the facial landmarks from an image.
* `utils.py`: This file contains utility functions such as loading an image from a file path, converting an image to grayscale, resizing an image, calculating the Euclidean distance between two points, and computing the eye aspect ratio.
